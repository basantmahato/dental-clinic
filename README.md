## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the frontend project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

You need the following software installed:

* **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)
* **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **yarn**

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/basantmahato/dental-clinic.git](https://github.com/basantmahato/dental-clinic.git)
    cd dental-clinic
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    This command starts the local development server and typically opens the application in your browser.
    ```bash
    npm run dev 
    # or 
    npm start 
    # (depending on your project's configuration, check package.json)
    ```

The application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:[Port Number]` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:5173`).

## üîó Backend Connection

*This is a standalone frontend project.*

To make it fully functional (e.g., allowing appointments to be booked or data to be managed), it needs to be connected to a dedicated backend API.

* **API Endpoint:** `[Insert expected backend API URL here, e.g., http://localhost:5000/api]`
* **Required Environment Variable (if any):** Check the codebase for any API key or base URL variables needed in a `.env` file.
